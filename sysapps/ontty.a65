    GeckOS/A65 Version 2.0.0
    ontty program - run a program on another console

    This program is used to set up the standard I/O streams, including
    the - otherwise hidden - STDCIN, that keeps being connected to the 
    console even with input redirection. This is used e.g. by "more" to
    read commands from it, in an analogue to the original unix'es 
    reading from STDERR.

    In future versions this program may also set things like line 
    discipline etc.
