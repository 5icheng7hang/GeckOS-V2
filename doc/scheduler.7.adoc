== NAME
scheduler - description of the GeckOS scheduler

== DESCRIPTION
The GeckOS scheduler manages 

Environments::
	a defined memory mapping
Tasks::
	a 'process' running in an environment
Threads::
	a thread within a task.

Environments are specific for each port. A C64 only has a single environment, the 8296 uses two
environments for its two memory extension banks, a CS/A can have many of them, one for each 
task to provide proper memory isolation.

A task defines the STDIO streams, semaphore ownership, parent task, signal mask and hander, 
and for example the task name. It does not really have an own status for its own.

A task is started with a single thread. Each thread can have a specific status, that
tells the scheduler what to do with the thread when it is to be scheduled.

== THREAD CREATION
A task and associated thread are created with the *FORK(2)* system call. FORK uses the SENDBUF
to receive the necessary information from the parent task, like the STDIO streams, task name to
be put into the task table, or the initial priority. 

Depending on the port a new environment is created at *FORK(2)* when possible (e.g. CS/A architecture).
On *nommu(7)* architectures like the C64, no environment is created, only a task and a thread.

== STREAMS
A task has four streams, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR and STDCIN. In the *FORK* call the first three
must be given by the caller. Only the STDCIN task is automatically managed by the *FORK* call.
FORK uses the parent's STDCIN stream and registers a new reader (the new task).

On boot, when *FORK* is called by the kernel, STDCIN is set to the STDIN value.

The STDIO streams of the current task can be replaced using the *DUP(2)* call.

== PRIORITY
Each task has a priority. This priority is a crude measure of the number of times the 
scheduler interrupt can be called before the scheduler is invoked. It can be inherited
from the parent on *FORK* or set to a new value.

Using the *RENICE(2)* call the priority can be adjusted by the task itself.

The call *YIELD(2)* is often used to give way to other threads when there is nothing
to do in the current task. In a way this implements a simple form of cooperative
multitasking in addition to the interrupt-driven preemptive multitasking.

Using *SLOCK(2)* a thread can lock the scheduler onto itself. 

NOTE: *SLOCK(2)* may be going away in a future release

== TASK INFO
A task can get its own current thread and task IDs using *GETPID(2)*.

Using the *GETINFO(2)* call the system can provide information on the currently running processes.
*GETINFO* uses the SENDBUF to retrieve the task information.

When a task starts, the kernel enters the start of execution address in the task table.
In a *nommu(7)* architecture with *lib6502(7)* this does not help a lot, as all execution addresses may
point to the same address, the lib6502 entry point. A task may thus set its own 
start of execution address with *SETINFO(2)*.

== MULTITHREADING
A thread can start another thread in the same task using the *FORKT(2)* call.
When a thread is finished, it can call *TERM(2)* to terminate itself (i.e. the current thread) -
other threads (if any) continue running.

== END OF LIFECYCLE
When a task is finished, the last running thread can call *TERM(2)* itself to terminate itself.
If the current thread was the last thread of the task, the task is terminated.

A task can kill another task using the *KILL(2)* call.
On *KILL(2)*, all threads that still run are stopped and released.

When a task terminates (i.e. the last thread dies), e.g. through *TERM(2)* or *KILL(2)*,

- the STDIO streams are released by de-registering the reader resp. writer
- all semaphores held by the task are released
- tasks still waiting for *CHECKCHILD(2)* are released
- the parent task for still running children is set to $ff (invalid), they become detached.
- the parent task will get a SIG_CHLD event if enabled. In this case the own task status is 
set to waiting for CHECKCHILD
