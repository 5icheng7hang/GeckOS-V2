== NAME
startup - a description of the GeckOS boot process

== DESCRIPTION
When the GeckOS kernel starts up, the first thing is to initialize the memory mapping and system timer.
After that the internal structures are initialized. 
Then it expects to be able to access the boot "ROM" image, which is scanned for programs to execute.
The boot ROM has a number of entries chained together, so the kernel can easily find the programs to run.

In this process, the kernel starts entries of type *PK_DEV* and *PK_INIT* only. 
However, to be started, the type must be OR'd with *PK_AUTOEXEC* (bit 7 set).

PK_DEV::
	is to register the hardware device drivers (using *DEVCMD(2)*).

PK_INIT:: 
	usually only starts the *init(8)* program using the *FORK(2)* call. 

The kernel uses a device number stored in the ROM link chain entry
to open streams for STDIO of the programs.

NOTE: as the kernel can not allocate a separate PCBUF (SEND/RECEIVE buffer) for each started program,
these programs do not get their startup information from the PCBUF after FORK. 

The *init(8)* program then re-scans the boot ROM image, and starts the other entries, of types
*PK_FS*, *PK_PRG* and *PK_LIB*, using the *FORK(2)* system call. Again they are only started
as long as the *PK_AUTOEXEC* bit is set.

PK_FS::
	This entry is used for filesystems, where the code is stored in the boot ROM as executable code
	(as opposed to a relocatable file image that needs to be copied and relocated).
	STDIO for filesystems is set to STDNUL, 
PK_PRG::
	This entry starts code that is embedded in the ROM. Similar to the kernel, it uses the device numbers
	stored in the ROM link chain entry to open streams for STDIO.
PK_LIB::
	This entry is different in that it does not execute code in the ROM itself, but loads a lib6502 
	executable from the filesystem, using a (hidden) entry point into the lib6502 library.
	Again a device number from the link chain is used to determine the STDIO.

As these programs are started by init with the kernel already fully up and running, the normal
rules for getting startup information in PCBUF etc apply.

NOTE: the *init(8)* program also notes a specific *PK_RESTART* bit in the type byte, 
to identify programs that need restarting
when they finish. This way, init monitors these programs and re-starts them.
