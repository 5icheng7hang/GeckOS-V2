== NAME
sending and receiving messages

== DESCRIPTION
For certain commands, GeckOS needs more than just the CPU registers to transfer data to or from the kernel, 
or to other processes. For these purposes the SEND/RECEIVE interface is provided.

Using *SEND(2)*, a task can send a message of up to 256 bytes to another process. The other process
needs to call *RECEIVE(2)* to get the message.

As a remainder of GeckOS V1, this interface uses a fixed address for its buffer, the *SENDBUF*, sometimes
also called *PCBUF* (in userspace) or *SYSBUF* (in kernal space). 
To be able to use this in a system without MMU that would protect such a buffer by giving each task
an own memory area for it, a semaphore is used. Please see *semaphores(7)* for details on how to use
the semaphore.

The SENDBUF is located at $0200.

== USAGE
To send a message to another task, first allocate the SENDBUF semaphore. Then fill in the message to be sent
into the SENDBUF buffer. You can give a target task as destination, how many bytes to send and an optional
message type.

When sending with *SEND(2)*, if the destination task is already waiting for a message, the message is copied over to the 
destination task. In Non-MMU systems the copying of course is a no-op. The destination task is woken
up. 

If no destination task is waiting, then the sender will sleep until the destination task tries to receive 
the message, in which case the sender is woken up.

The destination task calls *RECEIVE(2)* to receive any incoming message. It can decide whether to block waiting
for a message or whether to return immediately.

*XRECEIVE(2)* can be used to receive a message only from a given task. This can be used for example after *SEND(2)*
to receive a message from exactly the task the first message was sent to.

=== SYSTEM DESTINATIONS
There are a number of system destinations.

SEND_SYS::
	The system task. Was used in GeckOS V1 for calls to the kernel itself (deprecated)
SEND_FM::
	filesystem task. This actually a multiplexer into all the registered filesystems
	(see *filesystems(7)* for more details)
SEND_ERROR::
	critical error handler (reserved and not yet used/implemented)
SEND_TIME::
	set/get actual time (reserved and not yet used/implemented)
SEND_NET::
	Communicate with the (TCP/IP) network handler

The task numbers are just numbers - if there is no real task behind it, the message cannot be delivered.
A task can thus register itself as destination task behind this system destination using *TDUP(2)*.

=== SYSTEM SEMAPHORES
The *SENDBUF* is protected by a system semaphore:

SEM_SENDBUF::
	Protects the use of the *SENDBUF* structure at $0200 that is used for various 
	kernel calls like *FORK(2)* or *GETINFO(2)*

Note that the "ownership" of the semaphore is transferred from the sending task to the receiving task for proper
resource management.
