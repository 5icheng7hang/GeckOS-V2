== NAME
c64 - describes the GeckOS port to the C64

== DESCRIPTION
The C64 is a machine that has a single environment with almost 60k usable RAM, and no memory management unit.


== ROM CONFIGURATION
The "ROM" is a boot image that is loaded into memory from ROMSTART to end of memory, where the C64 ROMs are 
completely mapped out and only RAM is used. In $dxxx of course the I/O area is used.

The configuration can be seen in arch/c64/c64rom.a65.

=== INCLUDED PROGRAMS
The ROM contains these blocks

devices/c64dev.a65::
	This contains the device handlers supported by the C64 architecture (see below)
sysapps/init/init.a65::
	The init program that starts all other progams, and is also able to restart them when they finish.
	See *startup(7)*
sysapps/fs/fsiec.a65::
	The filesystem driver for the IEC or IEEE488 interface of the C64.
	Note that usually the serial IEC is used. Using the *PARALLEL* define, instead the 
	Commodore IEEE488 interface module is supported.
	*fsiec(8)* uses CIA2 Timer B as serial bus timeout timer.
sysapps/mon/mon.a65::
	Old style shell program. Will be gone at some point.
slipd::
	This program is (optionally, depending on *INETSTART*) loaded from disk into memory during boot and started.
lsh::
	This program is loaded from disk into memory and started.

== KERNEL CONFIGURATION
The kernel is configured with these major configuration options:

STACKCOPY:: 
	The stack is divided into two parts - one for the system and one for userspace programs. 
	During context switch the userspace stack is copied over into a save area and the stack area
	from another task is copied in. This allows for an arbitrary number of tasks (in theory).

NMIDEV::
	Supports devices that run in the NMI (needed for the RS232 interfaces).

=== SYSTEM INTERRUPT
The C64 kernel uses the VIC-II raster timing interrupt as a 50Hz interrupt source.

== SUPPORTED DEVICES
This section describes the devices supported by GeckOS.

=== VIDEO
The video device provides three virtual consoles.

==== VIDEO OUTPUT
Video output is taken from the video buffers at $exxx (see memory map above), with a 40 column, 25 rows display,
using the C64's built-in VIC-II chip.

==== KEYBOARD MAPPING
The keyboard is mapped such that it can run on the real hardware, but also in the real machine.
Here are the important key mappings:

C=::
	switch between virtual consoles (left Ctrl on VICE)
Ctrl::
	The Ctrl-key. (VICE uses the Tab key to emulate Ctrl)
|::
	The pound symbol on the C64 enters the pipe symbol in GeckOS. In VICE the pipe can be entered just 
	as on the PC.

=== SER
The serial devices supported are based on the 9600 baud userport interface, the 6551 ACIA chip, and the 16550 UART.

==== 9600 baud userport
This device, usually "ser1", utilizes the 9600 baud interface by Daniel Dallmann. The two shift registers of the
two CIAs are used to shift out and shift in the data. A clever NMI routine that trigger on the incoming start bit 
and starts the shift-in of the data on the CIA's SDR makes this possible. This device needs the NMIDEV kernel 
configuration.

==== ACIA-based (classic)
The so-called classic ACIA describes my use of the ACIA in the C64. It uses the DSR input of the ACIA
as CTS input, to avoid the ACIA disabling receiver and transmitter when CTS is set. 

The definition of *ACIABASE* defines the base address of the ACIA and enables it. 
I originally had it in a circuit that I
put between the SID and the motherboard, so it was at $d600. 

NOTE: only low speeds (about 2400 baud) can be achieved due to the use of the IRQ interrupt instead of NMI.

==== ACIA-based (swiftlink)
This interface uses a swiftlink compatible module with ACIA, using the NMI routine to achieve the necessary speed.

Swift link must be configured to $de00, and using the NMI interrupt.

NOTE: this is not yet implemented and subject to change.

==== UART-based 
After the disappointing results with the ACIA, replaced it with a 16550 UART, that has a 16 byte input buffer.

Defining *UARTBASE* includes this device driver.
