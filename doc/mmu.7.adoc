== NAME
MMU - discussion how to run a multitasking OS on systems with an MMU

== DESCRIPTION
A memory management unit can take various different forms, from such simple forms as
bank switching in the CBM 8296, to the page-base MMU in the CS/A computer.

What should be common to those is that they enable the re-mapping of the CPU
zeropage, stack, and at least some memory areas.

The operating system supports these MMU functionality by
- generating new environments based on MMU mappings
- supporting the creation of tasks in the environments
- manipulating the environments with system calls where supported

So, for example in the 8296, the memory management can only re-map the
upper 32k into two banks of RAM, so the zeropage and stack cannot be changed.
Therefore the 8296 port has two environments, each located in one of the banks,
and uses the shared stack and zeropage.

The CS/A on the other hand can re-map any of the 16 4k address blocks to any
of the 256 real memory blocks. So it creates a new environment per task, 
with an own zeropage and stack, and provides only as much memory as needed per task.

=== ZEROPAGE AND STACK MANAGEMENT
In systems where the zeropage and stack can not be re-mapped per thread, 
the system uses the same approach as the *nommu(7)* as well. 

In systems where remapping the zeropage and stack is possible, they will be 
re-mapped for every thread separately.

In systems like the CS/A where zeropage, stack and SENDBUF cannot be mapped
separately, they are mapped per task. Within the environment the stack 
is then either split per thread, or managed using stackcopy.

=== SEND/RECEIVE BUFFER
The send/receive buffer is not in the stack or zeropage area, so some architectures
may not support the re-mapping of that memory area. In this case, the 
SEM_SENDBUF approach is used here as well.

=== MEMORY MANAGEMENT
For memory management, there are two levels - first the system needs
to know the available memory. In MMU systems the available memory
pages can be registered with *ENMEM(2)*.

Second, the kernel needs to know how to remap memory pages in an environment
to new addresses. This can be done using the *SETBLK(2)* call.

The kernel does no detailed memory management within an environment,
but it does know its boundaries. To modify the memory size of an environment
this can be done using *SBRK(2)*

Memory management within the enviroment needs to be done for example with 
the *lib6502(7)* memory management. 

=== PORTS OVERVIEW
These ports to MMU systems are currently available:

[options="header",frame="top"]
|====
|Port|CBM 8296|CS/A65
|Zeropage|lib6502 zalloc|mapped per task
|Stack|shared / stack copy|mapped per task / split
|SENDBUF|SEM_SENDBUF|mapped per task
|memory|one env system tasks, one for apps|mapped per task
