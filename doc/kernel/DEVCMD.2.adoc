== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* AC - command to execute on a device
	* XR - device number (except for DC_REGDEV)
	* YR - optional parameter

		** AC - error code 

NOTE: may modify any register

== DESCRIPTION
executes device commands. parameter: device number in x,
device command in a, optional parameter in y.
returns error code in a.

Possible stream commands are:

----
                DC_IRQ          0       execute IRQ routine
                                        the interrupt routine has to return
                                        E_OK if an interrupt source is cleared
                                        or E_NOIRQ if not.
                DC_RES          1       initialize device
                DC_GS           2       sets the stream (in y) the device
                                        reads from
                DC_PS           3       sets the stream (in y) the device
                                        writes to
                DC_RX_ON        4       switch on receive
                DC_TX_ON        5       switch off receive
                DC_RX_OFF       6       switch on send
                DC_TX_OFF       7       switch off send

                DC_SPD          8       set speed (in y), device dependend
                DC_HS           9       set handshake (in y), device dependend
                DC_ST           10      get device status, device dependend
                DC_EXIT         11      disable device, including IRQ sources

                DC_GNAM         16      get the name of a device, parameter:
                                        device number in x, returns
                                        name PCBUF ($0200)
                DC_GNUM         17      get number of a device from name,
                                        parameter: name in PCBUF, length
                                        of name in x, returns device number
                                        in x
                DC_REGDEV       18      register new device(s)
----

With the registration of the device the system has to know
what to do with it and where to put it in memory.
Therefore you have to put the address of the following
struct into x/y registers.

----
                x/y -&gt          2 byte pointer to label1
                                JMP Start_of_1st_device
                                Name_of_device,0
                                ...
                label1          2 byte pointer to label2
                                JMP Start_of_2nd_device
                                Name_of_2nd_device,0
                                ...
                labeln          $ffff
----

With this method it is possible to register several devices,
as long as they are in one memory block, with one call.

The devices are started with DC_RESET. In y they get a
system feature byte. Currently only bit 7 is defined,
where $00 is 1 MHz system clock and $80 is 2 MHz system clock.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NODEV:: no valid device number
