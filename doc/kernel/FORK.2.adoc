= FORK(2)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
FORK - create a new task and start executing it

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* SENDBUF - contains the FORK structure 
	* YR - length of the data in the SENDBUF
Call::
	jsr FORK
Output::
	* C=0
		** caller task
			*** XR - return the PID of the new task
		** forked task
			*** AC - value from FORK_PAR
			*** XR - own task ID
			*** SENDBUF - command line as given in FORK_NAME
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: may modify any register

== DESCRIPTION
The *FORK* call starts a new thread and a new task.
When calling, the SENDBUF must contain the following structure:

----
/* struct in PCBUF when FORK'ing */
	FORK_SIZE      0      size of needed memory in blocks (256
                              byte) from address 0 up
	FORK_SHARED    1      size of shared memory mapping in
                              blocks from address $ffff down
	FORK_PRIORITY  2      priority of task - 0 = parent's
	FORK_STDIN     3      stdin stream
	FORK_STDOUT    4      stdout stream
	FORK_STDERR    5      stderr stream
	FORK_ADDR      6      start address of task execution
	FORK_PAR       8      value of AC in new task
	FORK_NAME      9      task name (ended with nullbyte)
			      After that follows the command line as
			      list of null-terminated strings, ended
			      with a separate nullbyte
----

The commandline is put into the PCBUF of the starting task. The new task gets its own task id in x The stream read/write task counter are not changed. I.e. a thread that wants to use the end given to fork too has to increase the read/write counters itself. 

The priority is a hack to allow to run tasks with different execution priorities. The priority counts the number of interruptions before a thread switch occurs. Default value is 3. A value of 0 lets the new task inherit the priority of the current task. 

It is now somewhat difficult to really start a new task, as the READ/WRITE routines to access another tasks memory have been removed. The execution address of a new task should thus be code in a shared memory area, like the 
*lib6502(7)* loader code. This code can then load the actual file from disk (which is also much faster than
piping it though another task).

The FORK_PAR value is what is given to AC in the forked thread.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOENV:: 
	no free environment available
E_NOTASK::
	no task available
E_NOTHREAD::
	no thread available
