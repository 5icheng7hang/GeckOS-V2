== NAME
SEND - send a message to another task

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* SENDBUF - the actual message to send
	* XR - destination task number, maybe a system task (see *sendreceive(7)*)
	* YR - number of bytes to send (0 means 256 bytes)
	* AC - (optional) message type
Call::
	jsr SEND
Output::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - the real destination task number (unmodified if real number given as input, redirected number if system task

NOTE: AC and YR are preserved, XR may be modified.

== DESCRIPTION
Sends a message to another task. If the other task is already waiting for a message with *RECEIVE(2)* or *XRECEIVE(2)* 
then the message is copied over, and the sending task returns.

NOTE: to protect the SENDBUF resource, the *SEM_SENDBUF* semaphore must be held. The ownership of the SENDBUF
semaphore changes to the receiving task.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOENV::
	illegal task number has been given as destination
E_INT::
        a blocking SEND call was interrupted by a signal handler, while SIG_INT was set.
	On this error, X and Y are preserved, so that the call can easily be restarted
