:doctype: manpage

== NAME
CTRLNMI - control use of NMI

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* AC - either NMI_ON or NMI_OFF to allow or disallow NMIs
Call::
	jsr CTRLNMI
Output::

NOTE: this call changes all registers

== DESCRIPTION
This controls whether NMIs are enabled in the system. 
A task that wants to disallow NMIs for a while must call *CTRLNMI(2)* with the *NMI_OFF* value.
Devices or tasks that use NMIs are then instructed to not use NMIs until *CTRLNMI* is called
again with *NMI_ON*. 

The *CTRLNMI* code maintains a counter on the number of *NMI_ON* and *NMI_OFF* calls. 
Only if there are as many on calls than there are off calls, NMIs will be enabled.

To enable or disable NMIs, the NMI_ON or NMI_OFF flag is sent to all devices that 
use NMIs, using the NMI chain established by *SETNMI(2)* (for details see there).

== RETURN CODES

E_NOTIMP::
	Using a control code other than *NMI_ON* or *NMI_OFF*
