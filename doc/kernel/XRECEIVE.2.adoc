:doctype: manpage

== NAME
XRECEIVE - receive a message from a specific task

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=1 - waits for any message
	* C=0 - returns immediately with an error if no message received
	* XR - task the message is expected from
Call::
	jsr XRECEIVE
Output::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - sender task ID
		** YR - number of bytes received in PCBUF
		** AC - message type (if given by sender)

== DESCRIPTION
XRECEIVE receives a message. It behaves exactly like the *RECEIVE(2)* call, with the exception
that only messages from the given task ID are accepted.

In an RPC client, this could be used to accept only messages from the task that received the 
original message. For this *SEND(2)* returns the task ID of the destination call in XR.

NOTE: to protect the SENDBUF resource, the *SEM_SENDBUF* semaphore must be held by the sender. 
The ownership of the SENDBUF semaphore changes to the receiving task (that executes this *XRECEIVE*). 
Thus the *SEM_SENDBUF* must be released after receiving a message.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOTX::
	if non-blocking, and no message could be received.
