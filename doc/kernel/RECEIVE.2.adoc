== NAME
RECEIVE - receive a message from another task

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=1 - waits for any message
	* C=0 - returns immediately with an error if no message received
Call::
	jsr RECEIVE
Output::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - sender task ID
		** YR - number of bytes received in PCBUF
		** AC - message type (if given by sender)

== DESCRIPTION
RECEIVE	receives a message. It either waits for any message (if C=1) or returns immediately (if C=0), with
an error if no message has been received.
Otherwise if a message is received, 
return sender task id in x, length of
data in PCBUF in y (0 means 256) and the optional message
type as given with SEND in a.

NOTE: to protect the SENDBUF resource, the *SEM_SENDBUF* semaphore must be held by the sender. 
The ownership of the SENDBUF semaphore changes to the receiving task (that executes this *RECEIVE*). 
Thus the *SEM_SENDBUF* must be released after receiving a message.

Alternatively, on an RPC server, the task may keep the SENDBUF semaphore until it is able to 
reply with an own *SEND(2)* message to the sender of the original message, as returned by the 
RECEIVE call.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOTX::
	if non-blocking, and no message could be received.
