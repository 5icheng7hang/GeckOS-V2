== NAME
SETNMI - register a device for NMI handling (or clear NMI handling)

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=0: clear the NMI handler chain
	* C=1: add a new NMI routine
		** AC/YR - lo/hi of NMI routine to add
Call::
	jsr SETNMI
Output::
	undetermined

NOTE: this call changes all registers

== DESCRIPTION
At NMI address -2 there must be the address of a ctrl routine
that can be called via CTRLNMI. Expect that the 
ctrlnmi routine is called during this SETNMI  with either
NMI_ON of NMI_OFF in AC, to set the initial state.
The ctrlnmi routines is called with JSR, i.e. return with RTS.

At NMI address -4 is a pointer to a memory location
where the address of the next NMI routine can be found.
If the address found there is $ffff, then the list is at
its end.

A possible scenario then is:

Task calls SETNMI with NEWNMI in a/y. We then have the 
structure:

----
(NEWNMI-4)	address of oldvec -->   address of OLDNMI
(NEWNMI-2)	address of nmictrl			
NEWNMI -->  	NMI routine code
----

This way the structure can be held in ROM, and still allow
flexible NMI chaining. If CTRLNMI is called, each of the 
nmictrl routines is called with the given value in AC.

Each NMI routine must save all registers itself.
The NMI routine then at the end must perform a jump
to the oldvec address that *SETNMI* has stored in the vector pointed
to by the struct described above.

	.data
oldnmi	.word 0		; NMI vector in RAM

	.text		; this could be in ROM

	; NMI routine

	.word oldnmi	; address of oldnmi vector
	.word ctrlnmi	; address of own NMI control routine
