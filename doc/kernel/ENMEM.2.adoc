== NAME
ENMEM - enable a physical memory page for mapping

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* XR - one out of 256 physical memory blocks to enable for mapping
Call::
	jsr ENMEM
Output::
	undetermined

NOTE: this call changes all registers

== DESCRIPTION
The CS/A system has 256 pages of physical memory, each 4k in size. Each of these pages can be 
mapped independently into any of the 16 virtual 4k pages of the CPU.
During initialization the kernel needs to identify which memory blocks are available for mapping
into environments. It checks the first 32k, but there are further drivers (e.g. console) that enable
more memory using *ENMEM*

NOTE: this call is highly architecture dependent, and not available on Non-MMU architectures.
