== NAME
SBRK - set a memory block in the current task's memory mapping

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=1 - set the new size of available memory for an environment
	* C=0 - return the length of available memory in task, in 256 byte blocks
Call::
	jsr SBRK
Output::
	* C=0 - success
		** AC contains the length of available memory in environment, in 256 byte blocks

NOTE: this call changes all registers

== DESCRIPTION
The *SBRK* call allows to change the available memory for a given environment.

It sets the freely available RAM area in the active environment to ac blocks with 256 byte
each, by adding memory to or removing memory mappings
from the end of the already available memory area. Returns in ac the length
of the available memory in 256 byte blocks, if c=0 on return. Otherwise returns error.

This call assumes that each environent starts at the CPU address zero, and then counts the 
number of available memory pages. This can be used for example by a library that does memory
management within an environment.

== RETURN CODES
The call returns the number of 256 byte blocks available for the environment, counted from
the start of memory.
