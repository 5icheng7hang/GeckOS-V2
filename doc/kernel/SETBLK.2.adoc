== NAME
SETBLK - set a memory block in the current task's memory mapping

== SYNOPSIS
Input::

	* new value
Call::
	jsr ENMEM
Output::
	* C=1 - invalid index in mapping table
	* C=0 - success

== DESCRIPTION
In the CS/A architecture each environment has a mapping table that determines the mapping of the
environment's 64k address space into the 1M physical address space using 16 entries, one for each 4k block.
This mapping is loaded at any time the system switches to a new environment.

Using *SETBLK* the task can change its own memory mapping.
