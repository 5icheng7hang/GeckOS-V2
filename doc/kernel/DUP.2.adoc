	* C=0 - get redirected STDIO stream
		** XR - STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR/STDCIN constant
	* C=1 - replace STDIO stream
		** XR - STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR/STDCIN constant
		** AC - new stream number for STDIO stream
Call::
	jsr DUP
Output::
	* getting STDIO (C=0)
		** AC - redirected (true) STDIO stream number
	* setting STDIO (C=1)
		** AC - old stream

NOTE: registers are not preserved.

== DESCRIPTION
Each task has STDIO streams available. They can be used anywhere with their constants
*STDIN*, *STDOUT*, *STDERR*, and *STDCIN*. In some cases a task may need to know the real
stream number, or even replace the streams used for STDIO.

(carry=1): set new STD* stream. parameter: STD* number in x,
new stream in a, returns old stream in ac;
read/write task counters are not touched!

(carry=0): get redirected STD* stream number. parameter:
STD* number in x, returns stream in a

== ERROR CODES

E_NOSTR::
	invalid stream number (not any of STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, STDCERR)
